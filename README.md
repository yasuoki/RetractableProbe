The retractable probe of the Strix toolhead has been miniaturized and integrated into the X-carriage.  
The project features the following.

- Fits MGN12 X-rail only
- Replaces OMRON TL-Q5MC, which has concerns about heat resistance.
- Same size as the genuine VORON X-Carriage, so AfterBurner and StealthBurner can be used.
- Same weight as the genuine VORON X-Carriage with OMRON TL-Q5MC.
- Robust electrical circuits with no magnet-dependent electrical contacts.
- The accuracy of the probe depends only on the accuracy of the microswitch and not on the servomotor or spring.

# Caution
This probe is still under development and has not yet been tested for stability.   
I am trying to design a better, but something could go wrong and your 3D printer could break.
